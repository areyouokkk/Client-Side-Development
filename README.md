 You are required to work as an individual to develop a set of web pages using the 
templates that you designed in the first assessment piece, using HTML, CSS, and 
JavaScript (jQuery frameworks permited). Design changes from the first 
assignment will be allowed provided they are accompanied with justification to
why that change was made, whether that is from feedback (from Assessment 
One or potential users/stakeholders), user testing, further background research, 
etc. 
Utilising HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, without relying on a web editor, to develop 
a user-friendly and interactive dynamic website based on the design from 
Assignment One. Students are required to apply the key concepts and methods 
covered during the module in the implementation, testing, and evaluation of 
their dynamic website. The website should contain multiple pages. The website 
should be standards-compliant and is capable of gathering and conditioning data 
supplied by a user. Users should be able to browse all the information. Dynamic 
interactive design and event handling techniques (for example, animations, 
banners, image effects, date/time, form validation, calculator, and 
cookies/LocalStorage) are required. You will be required to develop a video to 
effectively express the key features in action and the degree of personalization 
to evidence the producï¿½on of well-formed web pages.
